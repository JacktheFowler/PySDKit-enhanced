    Variational Mode Extraction, a useful decomposition algorithm to extract a specific mode from the signal.

    The VME is a robust method when there is no need to decompose the whole signal.
    Indeed, if the aim is to achieve a particular mode from the signal VME is the best choice
    (just by knowing an approximation of the frequency band of the specific mode of interest).
    Indeed, VME assumes that signal is composed of two parts: F(t)=Ud(t)+Fr(t); in which F(t) refers to input signal,
    Ud(t) is the desired mode, and Fr(t) indicates the residual signal.
